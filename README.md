# Cyrus-Movement-System
## Bug-Fix
- [X] Dash executes despite random WASD movement -> Reduce tapSpeed and add debounce (lastKeyPressed)
- [X] Debris moves Humanoid Angle -> Set Humanoid Angle Constant
- [X] Camera Glitches After Respawn -> Disconnect connection before reconnecting
- [ ] Debounce for Dash to Sprint Animation -> Edit Default Animations based on WalkSpeed instead of local remote event
- [ ] Sprint Animation executes without moving


## Recommendations
- [X] BodyVelocity instead of Velocity for Dash? -> nah
- [X] Longer Cooldown? -> nah
