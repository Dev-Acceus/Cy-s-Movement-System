# Cyrus-Movement-System
## Bug-Fix
- [ ] Debounce for Dash to Sprint Animation
- [ ] Dash executes despite random WASD movement -> Reduce tapSpeed and add debounce (lastKeyPressed)
- [ ] Debris moves Humanoid Angle -> Set Humanoid Angle Constant
- [ ] Camera Glitches After Respawn
- [ ] Sprint Animation executes without moving

## Recommendations
- [ ] BodyVelocity instead of Velocity for Dash?
- [ ] Longer Cooldown?
